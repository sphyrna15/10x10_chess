Chess played on a 10 by 10 board instead of 8x8 with 3 ranks of figures which include 6 new ones:

- Unicorn
- Eagle
- Cardinal
- Hammer
- Arrow
- Minister

## Rules 

Disclaimer: I did not invent this Game, I bought it online @ https://www.das-grosse-schach.de/ and enjoyed it so much that I though it would be cool to implement an engine for it in Python 

You can find the Rules for the new figures @ https://www.das-grosse-schach.de/spielregeln-1/ 

## Installation 

Simply Clone the Github repo and run "chessMain.py" - Alternatively, you can download all the files from the repository and run "chessMain.py" in your Python environment. The only required libraries are "numpy" and "pygame". 

HAVE FUN!
